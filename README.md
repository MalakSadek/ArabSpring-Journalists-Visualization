# Arab Spring Journalists Visualization
A Tableau visualization showing the Arab Spring's effect on journalists in the MENA regionüóûÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è (2020).

The visualization consists of two `Tableau` dashboards. One explores the effect that the Arab Spring has had on jounralists in the MENA region, while the other explores the possible causes of the Arab Spring. The first dashboard has four views. There is also a gender filter, a toggle switch to view killed vs. imprisoned journalists, a slider for time period, and the ability to select or highlight specific countries. Each view also has an interactive feature where hovering over a data point highlights the data belonging to its corresponding country across all the views. 

The dataset was filtered to contain data from 16 Arab countries, from the years 2006-2019 (5 years before the Arab Spring until present day to provide wider context). Unwanted columns were removed and multiple columns were split up (more details later). Names were considered unique and ‚Äòcount distinct‚Äô was used for different totals.

The second dashboard focuses on the possible contributing factors that might have directly or indirectly helped bring on the Arab Spring. These factors are obtained from common or general knowledge from the region, as well as research papers published on the topic. The dashboard focuses only on 2012 (which was when most studies were conducted) and on the four countries which were the epicenter of the Arab Spring‚Äôs beginnings. The top main visualization can interactively filter other visualizations based on country when clicked on, but the other visualizations cannot act as filters. The main visualization is also filterable by education level, employment type, age group, and monthly household income. Since the income is presented in local currency in 2012, the dashboard features a webpage showing exchange rates for US dollars on 01/01/2012 for viewers to grasp the value more clearly. It also provides a button to go back to the first dashboard.
